                    <p>Edited by Gemtree Mortgages 19/02/2016</p>
                    <p>Today, Westpac Bank and St George bank has announced the changes to foreign income and employment verification that will start from 22 February.</p> 
                    <p>The new policy requirement will apply where an applicant who is an Australian citizen (as evidence by their Australian passport) has foreign income and employment. At application lodgement, evidence of a work permit/work visa is to be obtained from the customer to confirm they have the ability to reside and work within the foreign country.</p>

                    <p><span class="icon fa fa-bell-o "></span> Where the applicant is earning foreign income, does not hold dual citizenship with the foreign country and does not meet the definition of non-resident (as per Residential Policy Guide 9.1), obtain copies of:</p>

                     <p style="margin-left:5%">• Applicant's Australian passport  </p>
                     <p style="margin-left:5%">• Work permit / work visa for the country of employment.</p>

                     <p><span class="icon fa fa-bell-o "></span> Where the applicant is earning foreign income and DOES hold dual citizenship with the foreign country obtain copies of:</p>
                     <p style="margin-left:5%">• BOTH foreign and Australian passports</p>
                     <br/>

                    <p>To celebrate the New Year and improve the products’ advantages, the wide range of lenders we represent offer our customers:</p>
                    <p><span class="icon fa fa-bell-o "></span>  Competitive pricing of interest rates. Eg. 1.55% p.a. discount available for your owner occupied and investment lending.</p>
                     <p><span class="icon fa fa-bell-o "></span>  95% LVR including LMI capitalised can be applied on either owner occupied or investment lending. Your visa status is required to meet the criteria.</p>
                     <p><span class="icon fa fa-bell-o "></span>  Refinance application may qualify for a cash rebate as much as $1500.</p>
                     <p><span class="icon fa fa-bell-o "></span>  If you have a home loan for owner occupied property with the lender, any investment property you bring across will qualify for a lower interest rate. Or refinance the owner occupied loan and investment loan to the same lender.</p>
                      <p><span class="icon fa fa-bell-o "></span>  First year of loan package annual fee is waived from  certain lenders.</p>
